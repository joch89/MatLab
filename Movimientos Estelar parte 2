Stellar Motion - Part 2
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

This code loads the data from the previous project.
load starData

Task 1
[sHa,idx] = min(spectra);
lambdaHa = lambda(idx);
z = lambdaHa/656.28 - 1;
speed = z*299792.458

Tasks 2 - 4
for c = 1:7
    s = spectra(:,c);

    if speed(c) <= 0
        loglog(lambda,s,"--")

    else speed(c) > 0
        loglog(lambda,s,"LineWidth",3)
    end
    hold on
end
    hold off
Task 5
legend(starnames)


Task 6
movaway = starnames(speed > 0)
